Houdini Terrain Generation - The Icy Mountain of Sleeping Giant
==================================
**University of Pennsylvania, CIS 566: Procedural Graphics, Project 4, Haoquan Liang**   
# Overview
In this project, we are exploring the powerful capabilities of Houdini in terrain generation. We will be experimenting different nodes and functions to create interesting-looking terrains with assets scattered on it.     
I wouldn't be able to get my result without [The Complete A-Z Terrain Handbook](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/the-complete-a-z-terrain-handbook/) by [Nikola Damjanov](https://www.sidefx.com/profile/damjanmx/). I learned a variety of heightfield nodes from this tutorial, and I followed its ideas in `08: ICY BIOME HF Breakdown` to get the snow-layered look in my terrain. I also followed `13: ICY BIOME Shaders and Rendering` to apply complex shading to the terrain.

# Features
* Complex snowy-mountain themed terrain with 40 nodes
* Snow-themed conifer trees generated by L-System, scattered naturally on the terrain (avoiding icy lakes, mountaintop, and giant human head)
* HDA widget that allows the user to change tree number/size/complexity(L-system iteration), and height of the mountains
* Advanced terrain shading with cop2net. 


### Terrain
 ![overview](/img/terrain.jpg)   
 Terrain generation can be broken down into 6 steps.   
 **1. Shape**   
 I want the terrain to have mainly visible four mountains. So I chose to scatter 4 tubes on a grid, and then project it to the heightfield. However, that will make the mountains look very uniform and pointy, so applying some blurs, noises, and distorts to make it look more natural.    
 **2. Noise**   
 **3. Erosion**   
 **4. Terrace**   
 **5. Blend Giant Head**   
 **6. Slump**
